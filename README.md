# Multiple Experts Learning
Code for learning ground-truth labels from multiple experts in Bayesian supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios.
Developed as part of my UCL Master's Thesis.

The approach broadly follows that outlined in [Raykar et al. (2009)](http://facweb.cti.depaul.edu/research/vc/seminar/Paper/37.pdf) and applies to the following scenarios:
 1. Learning the ground truth binary classification labels for a dataset given a set of annotations from experts
 2. Learning ground truth labels and a classifier for a dataset given expert annotations and a feature set
